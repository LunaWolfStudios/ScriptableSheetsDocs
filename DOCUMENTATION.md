## Setup
1. **Pre-requisites**:
   - Ensure you have imported these Unity packages:
     - `com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json`
     - `com.unity.test-framework`
2. **Source Control**:
   - If you are using source control, it is recommended to ignore the `UserSettings` folder under the root Unity project directory.
3. **Opening Scriptable Sheets**:
   - Navigate to `Window -> Scriptable Sheets` to open your first Scriptable Sheets window.
4. **Different Unity Asset Types**:
   - In the top left corner of the window, you can select the Unity asset types you'd like to explore in Scriptable Sheets. By default it'll be set to ScriptableObjects.
5. **Select Object Type**:
   - Use the next dropdown to select a serializable Object type that is of the Unity asset type you chose.
   - The available ScriptableObject types will be based on your selected Scan Option setting.
6. **Accessing Settings**:
   - To open settings, navigate to `Edit -> Project Settings -> Preferences -> Scriptable Sheets` or right-click the title of any Scriptable Sheets window and select "Open Settings Window".

## Toolbar Buttons
- **Edit New Asset Path**: Specify the folder where new assets are created.
- **Rescan**: Trigger a rescan operation to look for new assets created outside of Scriptable Sheets.
- **Pin**: Pins the Object Type to the toolbar.

## Experimental Settings
Settings that may cause unexpected behavior. Use at your own risk.

- **Rendering Overrides**: Serialized property types added here will override Scriptable Sheets' default rendering behavior, allowing the use of custom property drawers and attributes. This may disrupt the table layout or cause unexpected behavior. Use at your own risk.

## Google Sheets Importers

Google Sheets Importers allow you to import data with a single click from any Google Sheet that is accessible via a shared link.

### Creating Importers

1. **Create a new importer**
   - Right-click in the Project window and navigate to:
     `Create -> Scriptable Sheets -> Google Sheets Importer`
   - Alternatively, use Scriptable Sheets to create new importers.
   - Ensure each Google Sheets Importer is in an Editor only folder.

2. **Assign an Object type**
   - Assign the `MonoScript` associated with the desired Scriptable Object.
   - For non-ScriptableObject types you can enter the full type name such as `UnityEngine.GameObject` for Prefabs.
   - For Sub Assets you can assign an optional Main Asset, which is only needed if you want to group your Sheets by Main Asset.
   - This links the importer to the correct Object type.

3. **Enter the Google Sheet details**
   - Enter the "Sheet ID" found in your Google Sheets URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SHEET_ID`
   - Enter the "Sheet Name" found in your Google Sheet. This is **case-sensitive**, so ensure accuracy.
   - Ensure your Google Sheet's share settings are set to **"Anyone with the link"**.

4. **Repeat** for each Google Sheet you want to import, updating the "Sheet ID" and "Sheet Name" as necessary.

### Assigning Importers

1. Open **Scriptable Sheets Settings**.
2. Scroll down to **Google Sheets Importers**.
3. Click **Scan** to automatically detect and assign the importers.

### Importing Data

1. Ensure you have pre-created enough Scriptable Objects.
   - Scriptable Sheets will **not** create new Scriptable Objects during import.
   - Make sure you have the correct number of Scriptable Objects to match the rows in your Google Sheet.

2. Select a Scriptable Object type in Scriptable Sheets that has an importer assigned.

3. Under Settings review your [Data Transfer Settings](#data-transfer-settings).
   - If the Google Sheet has headers ensure you enabled "Headers".
   - If you have multiple pages of Objects disable "Page Rows Only".
   - If you have exceeded the visible column limit disable "Visible Columns Only".

4. Click the `Import CSV from Google Sheets` button on the toolbar.
   - CSV import settings will be used with double quotes as the wrap option.

# Paste Pad

Paste Pad is a lightweight text editor for Unity and included as part of Scriptable Sheets. You can open a new Paste Pad directly from the Scriptable Sheets Toolbar. You can have as many Paste Pad windows open as you'd like. Paste Pads do NOT persist across sessions. Use Paste Pad to hold various strings either copied from Scriptable Sheets or elsewhere. This text can be edited and pasted into a Scriptable Sheets table, row, column, or cell. All data in Scriptable Sheets can be exported as a string, making Paste Pad a powerful tool for quick edits.

## Context Menu
- **Clear**: Clears the text of the Paste Pad.
- **Copy**: Copies the text of the Paste Pad to the clipboard.
- **New**: Opens another Paste Pad window to start a new text.
- **Save**: Saves the text of the Paste Pad to a file.
- **Word Wrap**: Toggles word wrap for the text in the Paste Pad.

# Tips

## Additional Controls
- **Column Headers**: Right-click the column headers to hide/show them individually.
- **Context Menu**: Right-click the Window name to access the context menu in Unity. The context menu for the Scriptable Sheets window contains a number of shortcuts and features as outlined under the [Context Menu](#context-menu) section.
- **Editing Text**: Press 'ENTER' when editing an input field to get full control over the text position within the input field. Press 'ENTER' again to apply your changes. Press 'ESC' to cancel.
- **Navigating Cells**: When a cell is focused you can navigate to the next cell with arrow keys, tab, or pressing enter twice (if you're in an input field). Hold shift to go in the opposite direction. The scroll view should automatically update as you scroll, but occassionally it can get stuck, especially in cases where the next cell is a null array element.

## Advanced Search Filtering

By default, the search bar filters Objects by name. Scriptable Sheets also supports advanced expressions to filter Objects by GUID, asset path, and any Object properties.

- **GUID**: `g:` or `guid:` followed by a GUID will filter Objects where their GUID starts with or contains the specified string. Example `guid:f1a42`.
- **Asset Path**: `ap:`, `path:`, or `assetpath:` followed by an asset path will filter Objects with a matching asset path. Generally, you should start from the `Assets/` directory. Example `path:Assets/Samples/`.
- **Property**: `p:`, `prop:`, or `property:` followed by a full property path, a filter operation, and a value will perform an advanced property search. Examples include `p:health>30` or `prop:myColor==FF0000`.
  - **Filter Operations**:
    - `=` or `==` (equals)
    - `!=` (not equals)
    - `>` (greater than)
    - `<` (less than)
    - `>=` (greater than or equal to)
    - `<=` (less than or equal to)
	- `~=` or `=~` (contains)
	- `!~` or `~!` (does not contain)

Property searches can be performed on any column within Scriptable Sheets. Ensure you use the full property path, with exact casing, and avoid extra whitespace.

The contains filter operations will adhere to your `Search Settings`. This allows you to filter for properties that match partial values.

When performing property searches on enums you can enable `Use String Enums` to filter enum values by string. Partial value searches do not work with string enum values.

To search for null Object references use a question mark character `?` as the filter value. Example `p:myObject=?`.

## Data Serialization and Transfer
- **Double Quotes**: Google Sheets may not handle double quotes within cells correctly, leading to import/export issues. It's best to set "Escape Mode" to "Repeat" to ensure proper handling when using Google Sheets.
- **Export to Json**: You can export to Json using the context menu of the window menu 'Copy Json' option or by using the save button and changing the extension to '.json'.
- **Flat File Export/Import**: When exporting or importing a flat file, it will attempt to auto-detect the delimiter.
- **Newlines in Flat Files**: When importing flat files, ensure you're using the correct newlines. Typical default newlines are `\r\n` for Windows, `\n` for Linux, and `\r` for Mac. This is especially important when copy-pasting content directly.
- **New ScriptableObjects**: For a new ScriptableObject, you can use the 'Assembly' Scan Option to find all ScriptableObject types, even those that haven't been created.
- **Null Object References**: Object references that are null will appear as "null" when serialized to a flat file format. If they are part of an array and that index does not exist, they will appear as an empty string.
- **Serializable Attribute**: For Object types to be picked up by the 'Assembly' scan option, those Object types require the `System.Serializable` attribute.

## External Tools
- **Google Sheets**: Google Sheets uses '\t' delimiter for columns by default. If you are using a different delimiter in Scriptable Sheets, then you'll need to [split data into columns](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6325535) after pasting into Google Sheets.
- **Line Endings**: Use a text editor like Notepad to change line endings to match your row delimiter setting before pasting content across cells. The Paste Pad Editor Window will default to '\n' for new lines entered directly. It will copy-paste '\r\n' accordingly.

## Performance
- **Complex Objects**: Avoid creating arrays of complex types within your ScriptableObject directly. Instead turn those complex types into their own ScriptableObjects. This not only improves performance within Scriptable Sheets, but also gives you another layer of organization. Under the provided RPG sample see how the Unit ScriptableObject references the Weapon ScriptableObject.
- **Large Arrays**: Large arrays will slow down performance. Consider moving larger arrays into a separate ScriptableObject and referencing that in your parent Object to improve performance. Under the Collections sample see how a StringCollection is created from a base ScriptableCollection.
- **Pagination**: Leverage row pagination to improve performance when working with a large number of Objects. You can still copy/paste and import/save across all rows and columns by disabling the "Page Rows only" and "Visible Columns Only" settings.
- **Show Arrays**: Disabling "Show Arrays" setting can improve performance when Objects have large arrays.
- **Show Children**: Disabling "Show Children" setting can improve performance when Objects have deeply nested fields. Note that "Show Children" must be enabled to show arrays.
- **Visible Columns**: You can right-click the column header to hide/show any column. There are also buttons on the left side to hide/show all columns at once. If the visible columns counter turns yellow that means the visible columns limit has been reached, but there are more columns to be displayed. You can increase this under `Settings -> Workload -> Visible Column Limit`.
- **Window Size and Virutalization**: If you have a lot of rows and columns, and hiding them is not an option. Then try shrinking the Window size so they aren't all rendered on every Repaint. The "Virtualization" setting will only render the cells in the Scroll View.

## Unity
- **Additional Unity Types**: Additional Unity types like GUISkins and TimelineAssets can be found under the 'Assembly' Scan Option setting. If an instance of those types already exists then 'Default' Scan Option should pick them up as well. If you can't find a specific Unity Type it could be that it's nested under another type (e.g. Render Textures will be under Texture).
- **Addressable Asset References**: Under `Settings -> User Interface` you can toggle "Show Read-only" to view the the internal values of Addressable Asset References. To view the standard Object fields disable "Show Read-only".
- **Create Asset Menu Attribute**: You no longer need to include the 'CreateAssetMenu' attribute on your ScriptableObject classes.
- **New Object Detection**: When you select a new Object type, it will automatically detect the first folder any instance of that Object type appears in and set that as the asset path for newly created Objects of that type.
- **Paste Pad Context Menu**: The context menu of the Paste Pad window contains shortcuts for clearing, copying, saving, and toggling word wrap.
- **Recommended Layout**: Set up a layout with the Scriptable Sheets Settings window, the Scriptable Sheets window, and an Inspector window all side-by-side.
- **Unity 6**: All editor windows are created as floating windows at first. You can grab the inner window and drag it to dock it.

# Limitations / FAQ
- **Array Copying**: Does not support copying an entire array from the Inspector window and pasting it across the equivalent array cells in the Scriptable Sheets window. Use the copy row button within the Scriptable Sheets window instead.
- **Array Display**: The first non-sorted Object on the first page drives the column layout. When showing arrays, this means only up to that Object's array sizes will be displayed. This avoids performance issues with a large number of Objects, arrays, and nested arrays. If you edit any of this Objects array sizes in the table view it will auto-refresh the column layout with the new array sizes, but if you edit it externally like in the Inspector window it will not update the column layout. Under `Settings -> User Interface` you can toggle "Show Arrays" followed by "Override Size", and then set a specific number of indices to display for each array.
- **Arrow Key Navigation**: Cannot navigate with arrow keys across missing cells when array sizes differ or across Addressable `AssetReference` types.
- **Automatic Object Creation**: Scriptable Sheets will not automatically create new Objects on import. Create Objects ahead of time before importing.
- **Base64 Encoding**: Animation curves and gradients will be serialized as base64 strings when using wrap options that are unsupported with Json like double quotes.
- **Column Widths**: Column widths are persisted per column in Unity 2021.2 and newer. Older versions of Unity do not support this due to API limitations.
- **Copying Cells**: Copying a single cell will not include headers.
- **Formulas**: There are no formulas for filling cells.
- **Ignored Elements**: Managed references, custom property drawers, and property attributes are ignored within Scriptable Sheets, but should continue to work in Unity's Inspector windows. You can override this behaviour using the "Rendering Overrides" setting under [Experimental Settings](#experimental-settings). Overriding the rendering behaviour may disrupt the table layout, use with caution.
- **Inspector Fields**: Copying certain property fields from the Scriptable Sheets window does not always allow you to paste directly into the Inspector window. It is recommended to paste the value within the Scriptable Sheets window for it to work as expected.
- **Json Flat File Import**: When importing a Json flat file where you modified the number of array elements, ensure you update the size property both in Scriptable Sheets and in the file prior to import. Otherwise, the array values will be null.
- **Json Hierarchy Serialization**: The visible columns setting is ignored when using hierarchy Json serialization because it serializes the entire structure of each Object.
- **Json Import**: You cannot paste Json directly across the table, rows, or columns. You can paste Json into single cells for certain Object fields, Animation Curves, and Gradients with the caveat being that the Json was copied from the Inspector or Scriptable Sheets window. You can copy to Json, save to a Json file, or import from a Json file you exported.
- **JsonDotNet Converters**: JsonDotNet converters do not apply, such as `JsonConverter(typeof(StringEnumConverter))`. For String to Enum conversion, enable the "Use String Enums" setting.
- **Mixed Value Fields**: Certain mixed value fields on default UnityEngine Components will not render as a flagged enum within Scriptable Sheets. Due to the underlying backing field being inaccessible.
- **Multiline Strings**: When working with multiline strings, ensure Smart Paste is enabled and Wrap Option is not set to none. You can then use Paste Pad to help edit multiline content and paste it back into the cell.
- **Numeric Fields**: `uint` and `ulong` numeric fields are only supported on Unity versions 2022.1 and later.
- **Session Persistence**: The state of each Scriptable Sheets window has several values that are preserved, including selectable asset types, selected asset type, selected Object type, pinned Object types, and other fields. If you exit Unity or close a window, it will attempt to preserve the states of each window. The saved session will try to persist when the assembly recompiles, but cannot handle every possible change given the reflective nature of the tool. Especially if you added/removed a type, it might reset the window or swap an index within the UI.
- **Settings Persistence**: Settings between sessions are not persisted in Unity versions prior to 2020.1. For this reason, we recommend Unity 2020.3 and up.
- **Use String Enums**: Use String Enums does not apply to flagged enums unless it's a single value and you prefix the name with 'Enum:'. They also do not apply to various default UnityEngine Components.

## Known Unity Bugs
- **Inspector Layer Masks**: When trying to copy layer masks in the Inspector window of Unity, you may get an index out of range exception. It is recommended to copy/paste layer masks within Scriptable Sheets windows only.
- **Multiple Windows**: If you have multiple windows docked at the same position, the tab order or active windows themselves might get swapped when the states are reloaded. This occurs if their instance IDs have changed internally. This can happen when maximizing editor windows or restarting Unity. In some cases you'll need to re-open a docked tab that might have been replaced with a new one.
- **Paste Pad Text Editor**: The text editor caret in the Paste Pad window will go invisible when editing large amounts of text, making it hard to select certain areas of the text.
